# Dev_Setup
Setup Development Environment

#Assignment: Setting Up Your Developer Environment

#Objective:
This assignment aims to familiarize you with the tools and configurations necessary to set up an efficient developer environment for software engineering projects. Completing this assignment will give you the skills required to set up a robust and productive workspace conducive to coding, debugging, version control, and collaboration.

#Tasks:

1. Select Your Operating System (OS):
   Choose an operating system that best suits your preferences and project requirements. Download and Install Windows 11. https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11


   My operating system is windows, operating with windows 10. My device doesn't meet the requirement for downloading windows 11, therefore, i can't have it on my device as it isn't compatible.


2. Install a Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE):
   Select and install a text editor or IDE suitable for your programming languages and workflow. Download and Install Visual Studio Code. https://code.visualstudio.com/Download


   I have already installed its latest version and its running perfectly on my device. hence the task is completed.


3. Set Up Version Control System:
   Install Git and configure it on your local machine. Create a GitHub account for hosting your repositories. Initialize a Git repository for your project and make your first commit. https://github.com

   I have already installed Git on my local device and its operating quite well. i also have my github account that i use to submitt the assignments. https://github.com/Elizabeth-Gitau
   Task completed


4. Install Necessary Programming Languages and Runtimes:
  Instal Python from http://wwww.python.org programming language required for your project and install their respective compilers, interpreters, or runtimes. Ensure you have the necessary tools to build and execute your code.

  I'm yet to install python since i don't really understand it completly but once i get it i will gladly install it in the comming weeks together with their compilers, interpreters,and runtimes
  Task yet to be completed.



5. Install Package Managers:
   If applicable, install package managers like pip (Python).

   the task is yet to be completed. but once i fully understand the purpose of package managers i will install it.


6. Configure a Database (MySQL):
   Download and install MySQL database. https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html

   MySQL database is already installed in my local machine, together with MySQL workbench of which they are operating perfectily.
   Task fully completed.


7. Set Up Development Environments and Virtualization (Optional):
   Consider using virtualization tools like Docker or virtual machines to isolate project dependencies and ensure consistent environments across different machines.

   I'm yet to complete this task. although optional i will consider doing it.


8. Explore Extensions and Plugins:
   Explore available extensions, plugins, and add-ons for your chosen text editor or IDE to enhance functionality, such as syntax highlighting, linting, code formatting, and version control integration.
    
    This task is in progress as I have started to explorer the VS Code to fully understand its functionality.

9. Document Your Setup:
    Create a comprehensive document outlining the steps you've taken to set up your developer environment. Include any configurations, customizations, or troubleshooting steps encountered during the process.  

I believe Documenting your set up is important, there for i have come with the following steps to navigate around my web development journey.

Development Environment Setup Guide
1. Introduction
This document provides step-by-step instructions for setting up a Python development environment using Visual Studio Code (VS Code). It is intended for developers working on Python projects who need a consistent and efficient setup.

2. Environment Setup
Software Requirements
Visual Studio Code: Latest stable version
Git: Version control system (optional but recommended)
Installation Instructions
Python Installation:

Download Python from python.org and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
During installation, ensure to add Python to the system PATH.
Visual Studio Code Installation:

Download VS Code from code.visualstudio.com and install it using the default settings.
Extensions for Visual Studio Code:

Open VS Code and install the following extensions:
Python Extension for VS Code: Provides Python language support including IntelliSense, linting, debugging, and code formatting.
GitLens: Enhances Git integration with features like line-by-line blame annotations, commit details, and repository history visualization.
Configuration
VS Code Settings:
Open VS Code settings (Ctrl + ,) and customize as needed. Example settings include editor preferences, Python interpreter path, and Git configurations.
3. Customizations and Extensions
Enhances Git functionality within VS Code, allowing for easier navigation and understanding of code history.
4. Testing and Validation
Testing Procedures:
Create a new Python project in VS Code, write a simple script, and execute/debug it to ensure everything functions correctly.
5. Maintenance and Updates
Version Control:

Use Git for managing code changes. Commit frequently and follow branching strategies as per project requirements.
Periodic Reviews:

Review and update software versions (Python, VS Code, extensions) periodically to benefit from new features and security updates.
    


#Deliverables:
- Document detailing the setup process with step-by-step instructions and screenshots where necessary.
- A GitHub repository containing a sample project initialized with Git and any necessary configuration files (e.g., .gitignore).
- A reflection on the challenges faced during setup and strategies employed to overcome them.

#Submission:
Submit your document and GitHub repository link through the designated platform or email to the instructor by the specified deadline.

#Evaluation Criteria:**
- Completeness and accuracy of setup documentation.
- Effectiveness of version control implementation.
- Appropriateness of tools selected for the project requirements.
- Clarity of reflection on challenges and solutions encountered.
- Adherence to submission guidelines and deadlines.

Note: Feel free to reach out for clarification or assistance with any aspect of the assignment.
